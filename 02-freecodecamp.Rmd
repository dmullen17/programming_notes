# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures FCC 
These are my notes from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification from the<a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript"> FreeCodeCamp lessons</a>

## Regex 
Example using the .test() method - pretty weird syntax with the string as the input. 
```
let myString = "freeCodeCamp";
let fccRegex = /freecodecamp/; // Change this line
let result = fccRegex.test(myString);
```
  
+ .match() extracts matches 
+ uses flags: i = case insensitive, g = more than the first match 
+ you can put whatever you want in a class: [aeiou] or [a-f], [a-z] etc. 
+ lazy matching - finds the smallest part of the string that matches the pattern
+ [\w] matches alphanumerics, [\W] matches non alphanumerics 
+ [\d] matches digits, [\D] is the inverse 
+ [\s] matches all whitespace characters, [\S] is the inverse 
+ `?` checks for all or none (think of it as optional)
+ .trim() and .replace() methods exist 


## Debugging 
Overall this wasn't the most informative section.  It mainly focused on common errors 
rather than debugging techniques.  I've done quite a bit of debugging though so I'm not 
exactly sorry that this section was short.
  
+ Use `console.log(typeof variable_name)` to return the type. 
    + Interestingly this isn't a function you wrap the object in.
+ OBOE - refers to off by one errors
   + if you access an out range index it `undefined` is usually the output
   + the following syntax should avoid this `for (let i = 0; i < obj.length; i++)`
<br> 


## Data Structures 
+ Arrays can store other arrays / JS objects 
+ `Array.push` adds elements to the end. `Array.unshift()` to the beginning.
    + .pop removes from the end / .shift removes from the beginning
+ `Array.slice(0:9)` - removes the first 10 elements 

The third (optional) argument in `splice` can replace an element.  This is a cool 
example of using it to update a color scheme: 
```
function colorChange(arr, index, newColor) {
  arr.splice(index, 1, newColor);
  return arr;
}

let colorScheme = ['#878787', '#a08794', '#bb7e8c', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf'];

colorScheme = colorChange(colorScheme, 2, '#332327');
// we have removed '#bb7e8c' and added '#332327' in its place
// colorScheme now equals ['#878787', '#a08794', '#332327', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf']
```
+ `slice` extracts array elements but doesn't modify the original array
    + `splice` is the same but it removes the selected elements 
+ the spread operator `...` allows us to copy arrays / insert them into other arrays 
    + `let thisArray = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];`
    + `let thatArray = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];`
+ `arr.indexOf('element')` returns the index or -1 if it DNE
+ `arr.includes()` returns a boolean 
<br> 

Basic object operations
+ Use the dot operator to access properties `obj.prop1.prop2 etc.`
+ You can also use bracket notation `obj[key1][key2]`
+ You can use the delete keyword to remove properties: `delete obj.prop1;`
+ `Obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)` returns a boolean - really useful! 
+ We can iterate through keys in an object: 
    + `for (let key in obj) {obj[key]...}`
+ `Object.keys(input_obj)` returns all the keys in an object. 


## Basic Algorithm Scripting 
I included algorithms because I either found them interesting, learned something new, or found them difficult to puzzle through.  
  
**1.** Cool reverse way to reverse a string with array methods: 
```
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```
  
**2.** Recursion solution to factorial problem: 
```
function factorialize(num) {
  if (num === 0) { return 1; }
  return num * factorialize(num-1);
}
```
  
**3.** Find the longest word in a string, my solution:
```
function findLongestWordLength(str) {
  let lengths = str.split(' ').map(word => word.length)
  return Math.max(...lengths);
}
```

**4.** Match 'x' amount of characters at the end of a string:
```
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
  return str.slice(str.length - target.length) === target;
}
```

**5.** My solution to: Title case every word in a string. The key here was remembering that the string method `.replace` takes regex as an input and then a callback function.  I had to use map in order to use replace on every element of the array.  
```
function titleCase(str) {
  return str.toLowerCase().split(' ').map(el => el.replace(/^.{1}/, letter => letter.toUpperCase())).join(' ');
}
```

**6.** Remove all "falsy" values from an array.  This method uses the filter function that takes a callback function and filters out values based on true/false output.  The `Boolean` functions returns T/F based on the input.    
```
function bouncer(arr) {
  // Don't show a false ID to this bouncer.
  return arr.filter(Boolean)
}
```

**7.** Check if the all the characters in arr[1] are in arr[0]. My weird solution below.  I could have incorporated `.indexOf` instead of findIndex, and `.every` which is the same as `all` in R.   
```
function mutation(arr) {
  let arr0 = arr[0].toLowerCase().split('');
  let arr1 = arr[1].toLowerCase().split('');
  return arr1.map(el => arr0.findIndex(letter => el===letter)).includes(-1) ? false : true;
}
```

**8.** Split an array into groups of `size` and return then in a two dimensional array.  The first solution is mine where I used a bunch of additional counter variables.  The second solution is really elegant. It creates a newArr to store results in.  The while loop keeps running while there are elements left in `arr`.  Then we push and splice until `arr` is empty.
```
function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  let newArr = [];
  let start = 0;
  let end = size; 
  let numIterations = Math.ceil(arr.length/size);

  for (let i = 0; i < numIterations; i++) {
    if (end > arr.length) {
      newArr[i] = arr.slice(start, arr.length);
    } else {
    newArr[i] = arr.slice(start, end);
    start += size; 
    end += size; 
    }
  }
  return newArr;
}
function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  var newArr = [];
  while (arr.length) {
    newArr.push(arr.splice(0,size));
  }
return newArr;
}
```
