## Basic Principles of Responsive Web Design 
My notes from [9 Basic Principles of Responsive Web Design](http://blog.froont.com/9-basic-principles-of-responsive-web-design/)

+ Responsive and adaptive are not the same thing
+ flow: as screen size becomes smaller, content takes up more vertical space and anything below it is pushed down - this is called `flow`.
+ use relative units - % instead of px
+ breakpoints - allow the layout to change at predefined points
+ use min and max values. A value of `width: 100%` on your phone could make sense but not on your tv.  In that case we could also set a `max-width: 1000px` for that use case. 
+ containers / nesting - wrap elements in containers so that the container can change shape / move, not each element which can get hard to control quickly.
+ webfonts look great but increase loading time, system fonts are much faster. 
+ Image scaling - if an image is going to scale watch out for pixelation - it might be better to use a vector (svg / icon font) to allow it to scale.

## Emojis in HTML
Emojis look like images but they're actually bucketed into the text category.  They're just characters, you can select, copy-paste, adjust their size, and they have a primitive numerical representation. 
  
+ To use them we can either use them directly or specify their unicode representation.
+[Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) is the best to go for copy-pasting emojis.
+In the `<head>` tag be sure to specify the charset as UTF-8 `<meta charset='UTF-8'>`.
+ HTML Codepoint: alternate way to represent an emoji 
    + `&#xCodepoint` 
    + for pizza the codepoint is: `&#x1F355`
    + tells the browswer it's a unicode character
    + F355 is its ID
+ CSS Codepoint: the format is `"\01F355"` for pizza.
+ Javascript: we use the `String.fromCodePoint()` method to specify a unciode representation. 
    + we can also specify it directly as a string. 
+ Character Viewer - we can use the character viewer to see a full list of unicode characters available to us. To open it on mac the command is `crtl + command + space`
+ All characters are actually represented like this.  A is represented as `U+0041`. 
    
Example: 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <title>Mouse move text shadow</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet'>
</head>
<body>
    <div class='container'>
        <h1 id='emoji'>:P</h1>
    </div>
<script>
    let emoji = document.querySelector('#emoji');
    emoji.innerText = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F355);
    emoji.innerText += 'ðŸ˜›';
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Parentheses in regex 
When using parentheses in regex they can denote a pattern we want to extract, then keep looking for more matches.  For instance in this function we pass in an `element.style.background` property in rgb format and extract the red, blue, and green components.  From there the function adds an offset to them. Something important to note is that the `.match` string method returns all characters that it matched up to and including the parentheses as `match[0]`.

```
function rgbColorOffset(rgbString, offset) {
    const matches = rgbString.match(/^rgb\((\d+),\s(\d+),\s(\d+)/);
    const colors = [matches[1], matches[2], matches[3]];
    return `rgb(${colors.map(color => (parseInt(color) - 255) * -1).join(',')})`;
}
```

### innerText vs textContent 
`innerText` was non-standard, while `textContent` was standardized earlier.
`innerText` returns the visible text contained in a node, while `textContent` returns the full text. For example, on the following HTML <span>Hello <span style="display: none;">World</span></span>, innerText will return 'Hello', while textContent will return 'Hello World'. For a more complete list of differences, see the table at http://perfectionkills.com/the-poor-misunderstood-innerText/.
As a result, innerText is much more performance-heavy: it requires layout information to return the result. https://kellegous.com/j/2013/02/27/innertext-vs-textcontent/

+ `innerText` is not present in firefox
+ Opera, merely computes textContent when you try to access innerText


### Advice for JR devs

+ write small, bite-sized divs.  Each commit should handle one thing
+ overengineered code.  Long functions, random helpers, too many if statements (write a design doc to organize)
+ APM - actions per minute, spend more of your time developing vs. reddit
+ don't have pride / ego - be open to suggestions / criticism 


## Chai.js

Automated tests: 

+ Unit tests: A single piece of code (usually an object or a function) is tested, isolated from other pieces
+ Integration tests: Multiple pieces are tested together, for example testing database access code against a test database
+ Acceptance tests (also called Functional tests): Automatic testing of the entire application, for example using a tool like Selenium to automatically run a browser.

Test Driven Development
TDD or Test-Driven Development is a process for when you write and run your tests. Following it makes it possible to have a very high test-coverage. Test-coverage refers to the percentage of your code that is tested automatically, so a higher number is better. TDD also reduces the likelihood of having bugs in your tests, which can otherwise be difficult to track down.

+ Start by writing a test
+ Run the test and any other tests. At this point, your newly added test should fail. If it doesnâ€™t fail here, it might not be testing the right thing and thus has a bug in it.
+ Write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass
+ Run the tests to check the new test passes
+ Optionally refactor your code
+ Repeat from 1

BDD - Behavior Driven Development 
BDD states that you test behavior - not implemantation.

This examples tests `implementation` because we're assuming that `counter.count` starts at 0.  However this could change based on our needs.
```
suite('Counter', function() {
  test('tick increases count to 1', function() {
    var counter = new Counter();
 
    counter.tick();
 
    assert.equal(counter.count, 1);
  });
});
```

This example tests `behavior` because we do not assume that `counter.count` starts anywhere.  Instead we test that `counter.count` has been incremented by one after calling `counter.tick()` - thus it could have been initialized to any starting value and the test would pass. 

```
describe('Counter', function() {
  it('should increase count by 1 after calling tick', function() {
    var counter = new Counter();
    var expectedCount = counter.count + 1;
 
    counter.tick();
 
    assert.equal(counter.count, expectedCount);
  });
});
```
