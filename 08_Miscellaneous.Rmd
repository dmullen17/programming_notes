## Basic Principles of Responsive Web Design 
My notes from [9 Basic Principles of Responsive Web Design](http://blog.froont.com/9-basic-principles-of-responsive-web-design/)

+ Responsive and adaptive are not the same thing
+ flow: as screen size becomes smaller, content takes up more vertical space and anything below it is pushed down - this is called `flow`.
+ use relative units - % instead of px
+ breakpoints - allow the layout to change at predefined points
+ use min and max values. A value of `width: 100%` on your phone could make sense but not on your tv.  In that case we could also set a `max-width: 1000px` for that use case. 
+ containers / nesting - wrap elements in containers so that the container can change shape / move, not each element which can get hard to control quickly.
+ webfonts look great but increase loading time, system fonts are much faster. 
+ Image scaling - if an image is going to scale watch out for pixelation - it might be better to use a vector (svg / icon font) to allow it to scale.

## Emojis in HTML
Emojis look like images but they're actually bucketed into the text category.  They're just characters, you can select, copy-paste, adjust their size, and they have a primitive numerical representation. 
  
+ To use them we can either use them directly or specify their unicode representation.
+[Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) is the best to go for copy-pasting emojis.
+In the `<head>` tag be sure to specify the charset as UTF-8 `<meta charset='UTF-8'>`.
+ HTML Codepoint: alternate way to represent an emoji 
    + `&#xCodepoint` 
    + for pizza the codepoint is: `&#x1F355`
    + tells the browswer it's a unicode character
    + F355 is its ID
+ CSS Codepoint: the format is `"\01F355"` for pizza.
+ Javascript: we use the `String.fromCodePoint()` method to specify a unciode representation. 
    + we can also specify it directly as a string. 
+ Character Viewer - we can use the character viewer to see a full list of unicode characters available to us. To open it on mac the command is `crtl + command + space`
+ All characters are actually represented like this.  A is represented as `U+0041`.
    
Example: 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <title>Mouse move text shadow</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet'>
</head>
<body>
    <div class='container'>
        <h1 id='emoji'>:P</h1>
    </div>
<script>
    let emoji = document.querySelector('#emoji');
    emoji.innerText = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F355);
    emoji.innerText += 'ðŸ˜›';
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
