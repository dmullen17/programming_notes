# Backbone

## Introduction
In a finished Backbone app, you don't have to write the glue code that looks into the DOM to find an element with a specific id, and update the HTML manually — when the model changes, the views simply update themselves.
  
Model
  
+ Orchestrates data and business logic.
+ Loads and saves data from the server.
+ Emits events when data changes.

View
  
+ Listens for changes and renders UI.
+ Handles user input and interactivity.
+ Sends captured input to the model.

A Model manages an internal table of data attributes, and triggers "change" events when any of its data is modified. Models handle syncing data with a persistence layer — usually a REST API with a backing database. Design your models as the atomic reusable objects containing all of the helpful functions for manipulating their particular bit of data. Models should be able to be passed around throughout your app, and used anywhere that bit of data is needed.

A View is an atomic chunk of user interface. It often renders the data from a specific model, or number of models — but views can also be data-less chunks of UI that stand alone. Models should be generally unaware of views. Instead, views listen to the model "change" events, and react or re-render themselves appropriately.

### Backbone logic 
From the client side the `Router` makes an HTTP request.  For instance (https://test.arcticdata.io/view/urn:uuid:375de5f7-d5cc-483e-b23b-a5199df73111) is an HTTP request.  From there it accesses `Views` and locates what it needs to render based on the request. When a view `event` is fired it will update the `Model`s based on the event which in turn updates the data source.  Then when the Models are updated they in turn update how the `Views` are rendered. 

## Views
The following syntax creates a backbone View using the `.extend` method. Then we create a new instance of the `AppView` view and call it newView.  The `initialize` property is run automatically on creation of a new object. 

```
  var AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
          initialize: function() {
              this.renderView();
              console.log('intialize runs by itself');
          },
          renderView: function() {
              console.log('Hello World');
          }
      });
      const newView = new AppView();
      //newView.renderView();
```


Views create an empty div as a DOM element by default. We need to select a DOM element to pass to a view.

### this.$el
`this.$el` creates a `div` element. If we don't specifiy which div we want to replace in the `el` property then it just logs an empty div 

```
      var FirstView = Backbone.View.extend({
          initialize: function() {
              this.render();
          },
          render: function() {
              this.$el.html('hello from the other side');
              console.log(this.$el);
          }
      });
      var fView = new FirstView({
          //el: '#content'
      });
```

### tagName, className, and Id
When creating a view we can specify the `tagName` (type of DOM element), the `className` (CSS class), and an id. It seems like this only works if we do not specify `el` when creating a new View.  This is why `//el: '#content';` is commented out.

```
    // Setting a tagName, className, and id
      const SecondView = Backbone.View.extend({
          tagName: 'a', // this will create an anchor element
          className: 'some-class',
          id: 'some-id',
          initialize: function() {
              this.render();
          },
          render: function() {
              this.$el.html('second view message');
              console.log(this.$el);
          }
      });
      const SView = new SecondView({
          //el: '#content';
      });
```

### el vs $el
By default backbone sets `this.el` to an empty div (a DOM element) and `this.$el` is a jQuery object that points to it. If we set a `tagName` then it will update the it to the provided element.


## Models
The following example shows using the Model constructor.  We create two instances of the shop model and use the `get` and `set` methods on its attributes.  You can also access them manually by `shopName.attributes.attributeName`.

```
      // Models
      // Create the Shop constructor? 
      const Shop = Backbone.Model.extend({
          defaults: {
              brand: '',
              type: '',
              price: 0,
              stock: 0
          }
      });
      
      // Create two Shop Model instances 
      const firstShop = new Shop({
          brand: 'Wilson',
          type: 'Basketball',
          price: 60,
          stock: 10
      });
      const secondShop = new Shop({
          brand: 'TF-1000',
          type: 'basketball'
      });
      secondShop.attributes.price = 59.99;
      secondShop.attributes.stock = 12;
      
      // Use get and set methods 
      secondShop.get('brand');
      secondShop.set('price', 100);
      console.log(secondShop.get('price'));
```


## Collections 
Collections are ordered sets of models. You can bind some events to be notified when any model in the collection has been modified. Events such as change, add, remove.

```
      // Create a Collection of Shops 
      const ShopCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
          model: Shop
      });
      const shopCollection = new ShopCollection;
      shopCollection.add(firstShop);
      shopCollection.add(secondShop);
      console.log(shopCollection);
      console.log(shopCollection.models);
      
      // Underscore each method to iterate over models
      shopCollection.each((shop) => {
          console.log(shop.get('brand'));
          console.log(shop.get('price'));
      });
```

## Views 2
The views handle user input and interactivity, renders data from the model and also sends captureed input back to the model. The views listen to the model "change" events, and react or re-render themselves appropriately.


## Notes from Backbone-fundamentals 

+ Backbone is a MV* framework.  It has models and views but the distinct controller functionality is baked into the Views / other components. 
+ SPA - web applications that load into the browser and then react to data changes on the client side without requiring complete page refreshes from the server
    + the goals of SPAs is to improve latency (the time before a page something loads after reciving a request).  After the initial page loads they're able to run faster as subsequent navigations and requests for data don't require new page loads. 
+ spaghetti code - unstructured and difficult-to-maintain source code

### When to choose MV*
If you’re writing an application where much of the heavy lifting for view rendering and data manipulation will be occurring in the browser, you may find a JavaScript MV* framework useful. Examples of applications that fall into this category are GMail, NewsBlur and the LinkedIn mobile app.

These types of applications typically download a single payload containing all the scripts, stylesheets, and markup users need for common tasks and then perform a lot of additional behavior in the background. For instance, it’s trivial to switch between reading an email or document to writing one without sending a new page request to the server.

If, however, you’re building an application that still relies on the server for most of the heavy-lifting of page/view rendering and you’re just using a little JavaScript or jQuery to make things more interactive, an MV* framework may be overkill. There certainly are complex Web applications where the partial rendering of views can be coupled with a single-page application effectively, but for everything else, you may find yourself better sticking to a simpler setup.

I think this relates to metacatUI b/c you're constantly moving around - switching from package to package and search to search - ask Chris about this 


### MVC with the web 
The web heavily relies on the HTTP protocol, which is stateless. This means that there is not a constantly open connection between the browser and server; each request instantiates a new communication channel between the two. Once the request initiator (e.g. a browser) gets a response the connection is closed. This fact creates a completely different context when compared to one of the operating systems on which many of the original MVC ideas were developed. The MVC implementation has to conform to the web context.

### Front Controller Example 
The way I understand this is that the controller handles everything. It branches off actions based off the request (usually HTTP).

**The Server receives an HTTP request and routes it through a single entry point. At that entry point, the Front Controller analyzes the request and, based on it, invokes an Action of the appropriate Controller. This process is called routing. The Action Model is asked to return and/or save submitted data. The Model communicates with the data source (e.g., database or API). Once the Model completes its work it returns data to the Controller which then loads the appropriate View. The View executes presentation logic (loops through articles and prints titles, content, etc.) using the supplied data. In the end, an HTTP response is returned to the browser.**

For example, let’s say we have our blog on www.example.com and we want to edit an article (with  id=43) and request http://www.example.com/article/edit/43:

On the server side, the Front Controller would analyze the URL and invoke the Article Controller (corresponding to the /article/ part of the URI) and its Edit Action (corresponding to the /edit/ part of the URI). Within the Action there would be a call to, let’s say, the Articles Model and its Articles::getEntry(43) method (43 corresponding to the /43 at the end of the URI). This would return the blog article data from the database for editing. The Article Controller would then load the (article/edit) View which would include logic for injecting the article’s data into a form suitable for editing its content, title, and other (meta) data. Finally, the resulting HTML response would be returned to the browser.

As you can imagine, a similar flow is necessary with POST requests after we press a save button in a form. The POST action URI would look like /article/save/43. The request would go through the same Controller, but this time the Save Action would be invoked (due to the  /save/ URI chunk), the Articles Model would save the edited article to the database with  Articles::saveEntry(43), and the browser would be redirected to the /article/edit/43 URI for further editing.

Finally, if the user requested http://www.example.com/ the Front Controller would invoke the default Controller and Action; e.g., the Index Controller and its Index action. Within Index Action there would be a call to the Articles model and its Articles::getLastEntries(10) method which would return the last 10 blog posts. The Controller would load the blog/index View which would have basic logic for listing the blog posts.
