  # Front End Libraries 
These are my notes from the Front End Libraries [certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/bootstrap) from FreeCodeCamp! 

## Bootstrap 
Bootstrap is a front-end framework used to design responsive web pages and web applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development. Bootstrap includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality. Bootstrap uses a responsive 12 column grid layout and has design templates for: buttons, images, tables, forms, and navigation.
  
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design. 

### Add bootstrap 
You can add bootstrap by adding this code snippet to the top of your HTML
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
```

### Bootstrap classes
class | explanation 
------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
`class = img-responsive` |  make an image fit exactly the width of your screen.
`class = text-center` | center text 
`text-primary` | 
`img-responsive` | 
`form-control` | 
`btn-default` | applies border radius 
`btn btn-primary` | applies border-radius, blue background, and white text styling
`div class='well'` | creates a perception of depth 

### Buttons 
Bootstrap has default button styles that look better than normal ones.  
```
<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
```
If we add the `btn-block` class it will expand to fill the horizontal space and any elements that follow it will be pushed to a new line. 
```
<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
```
The `btn-primary` class is the main color you'll use in your app.  We use this in place of `btn-default`
The `btn-info` is another color scheme that calls attention to the user. (lighter blue)
The `btn-danger` class provides a red styling - warns of a destructive action like deleting.  


### BootStrap Grid 
Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element. Bootstrap has different column width attributes that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is. For example, phones have narrow screens, and laptops have wider screens.Take for example Bootstrap's `col-md-*` class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

+ This example creates a 3 column row.  `xs` refers to extra small - for phone screens.  4 refers to the number of columns each `div` spans.  
```
 <div class='row'>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button></div>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button></div>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button></div>
</div>
```

+ Bootstrap's responsive system will resize images so that they fit on the same line. (Remove the bootstrap classes from the following html to see the effect) 
```
<div class='row'>
  <div class='col-xs-8'><h2 class="text-primary text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2></div>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><a href="#"><img class="img-responsive thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a></div>
</div>
```

+ We can also nest radio buttons in a responsive layout 

```
 <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Crazy</label></div>
  </div>
```

### span 
We can use a `<span>` element to create styles for inline elements. We then assign a class to the span to apply styling.   
```
.text-danger {
  color: red;
}
<p>Things cats <span class='text-danger'>love:</span></p>
```

### Font awesome
Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons are vector graphics, stored in the .svg (scalable vector graphic) file format. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements. You need to include the link to the Font awesome style sheet in the `<head>` element to use the icons. 
```
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
```

+ You can also use a `span` tag for FA icons: 
```
<span class='fa fa-info-circle'></span>
```

+ You can also put icons in buttons for added effect: 
```
<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> Like</button>
```

### Create a bootstrap layout. 
To create a responsive layout elements need to be wrapped in `div class='container-fluid></div>`.  You then use row and column classess to create desired layouts. 
```
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6">
  </div>
</div>
```

### Class targeting 
Sometimes we apply classes to html elements without any CSS styling to select them easie when using jQuery. Here we add the "target" class with no styling.   
```
<button class="btn btn-default target"></button>
```

<hr>

## jQuery
jQuery is one of the many libraries for JavaScript. It is designed to simplify scripting done on the client side. jQuery's most recognizable characteristic is its dollar sign ($) syntax. With it, you can easily manipulate elements, create animations and handle input events.

Add the following code to the top of the HTML document to initialize jQuery: 
```
<script>$(document).ready(function() {
});
</script>
```

### Methods 
#### selector 
All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling.
jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element. For example, let's make all of the button elements bounce. 
```
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
  $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
  });
</script>
```

We can target a classes and ids by using the same `.` and `#` syntax: 
```
$('.class-name').addClass('animated shake');
$("#target3").addClass("animated fadeOut");
```

#### Change CSS
We can change the CSS of an element by using the `.css()` function. 
```
$('#target1').css('color', 'blue');
``` 

#### Change properties
jQuery has a function called `.prop()` that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.
Here's how you would disable all buttons:
```
$("button").prop("disabled", true);
```

#### Change text inside elements
jQuery has a function called `.html()` that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.
```
$("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");
```
jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.


#### remove elements 
We can remove elements by using the `.remove()` function. 
```
$('#target4').remove();
```

#### move elements
jQuery has a function called `appendTo()` that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.
```
$('.class').appendTo('#id')
```

#### clone elements 
jQuery has a function called `clone()` that makes a copy of an element. We can use this in conjunction with `appendTo()` to copy-paste elements 
```
$('#id').clone().appendTo('.class')
```

#### parent function
jQuery has a function called `parent()` that accesses the parent of the selected element.  This examples changes the parent's background color 
```
$('.class').parent().css('background-color', 'blue)
```

#### children function 
jQuery has a function called `children()` that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.
```
$("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")
```

#### CSS Selectors 
jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. The `target:nth-child(n)` CSS selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type. NOTE: you don't select the parent element - you specify the class you're targeting and nth-child specifies what index you want.  A better name for this would be `nth-index`.  NOTE: this will also select that index for every grouping of these classes.  If, for instance, there are two lists and you want the second item, this will select the second item in BOTH lists.  
```
$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");
```
We can also target even or odd elements (based on index) with similar syntax: 
```
$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");
```

#### Hilarious page animation 
```
    $('body').addClass('animated hinge')
```

## SaSS 
Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available using basic CSS syntax. Sass makes it easier for developers to simplify and maintain the style sheets for their projects.

Sass can extend the CSS language because it is a preprocessor. It takes code written using Sass syntax, and converts it into basic CSS. This allows you to create variables, nest CSS rules into others, and import other Sass files, among other things. The result is more compact, easier to read code.

There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout these challenges, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.

The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just "Sass"), uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.


+ We can create variables in SaSS with the `$` and set their values. 

```
$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;
h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}
```

+ We can nest multiple CSS rules inside their parent elements 

```
nav {
  background-color: red;

  ul {
    list-style: none;

    li {
      display: inline-block;
    }
  }
}
```

### mixin
mixins are like functions for CSS.  Here is the syntax for defining one: 
```
@mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $c){ 
  -webkit-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  -moz-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  -ms-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
}
```
Now any time a box-shadow rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the vendor prefixes. A mixin is called with the `@include` directive:
```
div {
  @include box-shadow(0px, 0px, 4px, #fff);
}
```

```
  @mixin border-radius($radius){
    -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
    -moz-border-radius: $radius;
    -ms-border-radius: $radius;
    border-radius: $radius;
  }
```

+ we can also create if/else statements with `@if` and `@else`

```
  @mixin border-stroke($val) {
    @if $val == light {
      border: 1px solid black;
    } @else if $val == medium {
      border: 3px solid black;
    } @else if $val == heavy {
      border: 6px solid black;
    } @else {
      border: none;
    }
  }
```

### for loop
+ `@for` is used in two ways: "start through end" or "start to end". The main difference is that "start to end" excludes the end number, and "start through end" includes the end number.
Example: 
```
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .col-#{$i} { width: 100%/12 * $i; }
}
```
Here's what it looks like when it's converted to CSS:

```
.col-1 {
  width: 8.33333%;
}

.col-2 {
  width: 16.66667%;
}

...
.col-12 {
  width: 100%;
}
```

### each 
Same concept as for loop except you can define specific values - this is useful for colors

```
@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
```

### while 
Apparently these can break style sheets reeally easily - be sure to define the end clause FIRST.
```
$x: 1;
@while $x < 13 {
  .col-#{$x} { width: 100%/12 * $x;}
  $x: $x + 1;
}
```

### Partials 
Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.

Names for partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the .scss file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the `@import` directive.

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the main file:

```
// In the main.scss file
@import 'mixins'
```

### extend 
We can import the properties from one class to another class if we wish to add on (gets rid of excessive copy-pasting)

```
.panel{
  background-color: red;
  height: 70px;
  border: 2px solid green;
}

.big-panel{
  @extend .panel;
  width: 150px;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

## React 
React, popularized by Facebook, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create components, handle state and props, utilize event listeners and certain life cycle methods to update data as it changes. React combines HTML with JavaScript functionality to create its own markup language, JSX. This section will introduce you to all of these concepts and how to implement them for use with your own projects.
  
Intro: React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.
  
React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.
  
For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.
  
However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process. For your convenience, it's already added behind the scenes for these challenges. If you happen to write syntactically invalid JSX, you will see the first test in these challenges fail.
  
It's worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling `ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))`. This function call is what places your JSX into React's own lightweight representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.  

### Complex element 
Elements must be transpiled as single elements.  Therefore if you have multiple elements they must be wrapped in a single parent element. The following is invalid JSX (it needs to be wrapped in a `div` parent): 
```
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>
```
We can optionally wrap these declarations in parentheses - though it is considered good practice to do so. 

### Comments 
To add comments we use the following syntax: `{/* */}`

### Render HTML elements to the DOM
ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
);
ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('challenge-node'));
```

### Classes in JSX 
These declarations are slightly different because "class" is a reserved word in JS.  Instead we use "className" to define classes in JSX. The naming convention switches to camel case also - onclick becomes onClick, onchange to onChange, etc. 
```
const JSX = (
  <div className='myDiv'>
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);
```

### Self-closing tags
In html we can use some elements that don't include a closing tag like `<br>`.  In JSX all elements must either be followed by a closing tag or be written in self-closing format `<br>` --> `<br />`.  n JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <div>, on the other hand, can be written as <div /> or <div></div>. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the <div />. You will see in later challenges that this syntax is useful when rendering React components.
```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br />
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr />
  </div>
);
```

### Components 
Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component. There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. A stateless component is one that can **receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data**. To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null. One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.
  
Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.
```
const MyComponent = function() {
  // change code below this line
  return (
    <div>dummy text</div>
  );
}
```

#### Create a componenet with ES6 syntax 
```
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
```
This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class. So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks.
  
Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly.

#### Composition
We can put multiple components together into one - for instance navbar, dashboard, and footer components.  To compose then together we create a parent component that calls then.  They are called using self-closing JSX tag syntax. When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag.
```
return (
<App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
</App>
)
```

+ More extensive example: 

```
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
          <ChildComponent />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

+ Even more extensive example: 

```
const TypesOfFruit = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Fruits:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Blueberries</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

const Fruits = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <TypesOfFruit />
    </div>
  );
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
          <Fruits />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

#### Render components 
React components are passed into `ReactDOM.render()` a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example `ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode)`. You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.

#### Props to StateLess functional Component
In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders a child component called `Welcome` that is a stateless functional component. You can pass `Welcome` a user property by writing:
```
<App>
  <Welcome user='Mark' />
</App>
```
You use custom HTML attributes that React provides support for to pass the property `user` to the component `Welcome`. Since `Welcome` is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so.  In this example `Welcome` is also a component. 
```
const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
```

+ Example (pass information from a parent to a child through props): 
In this example we pass in the property (like passing in an argument to a function) like this `<CurrentDate date={Date()}/>`. Then in the child component we access its date property that we passed in like this: `<p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>`
```
const CurrentDate = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      { /* change code below this line */ }
      <p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>
      { /* change code above this line */ }
    </div>
  );
};

class Calendar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
        <CurrentDate date={Date()}/>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

+ Pass an array in as a prop.  We can call methods in the child component, in this case we call `join`

```
const List= (props) => {
  { /* change code below this line */ }
  return <p>{props.tasks.join(", ")}</p>
  { /* change code above this line */ }
};

class ToDo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>To Do Lists</h1>
        <h2>Today</h2>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
        <List tasks={['hackathon', 'React', 'exercise']}/>
        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
        <List tasks={['gym', 'redux', 'eat']}/>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

#### Default Props 
We can set default properties using the following syntax.  These are good for initial values. When we want to set numeric properties we have to wrap them in curly braces, this tells the browser to interpret them as javascript.  Ex: `return <Items quantity={10}/>`
```
const ShoppingCart = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart Component</h1>
    </div>
  )
};
// change code below this line
ShoppingCart.defaultProps = {items: 0}
```

#### PropTypes
We can specify what kind of type a property should. If the wrong input is passed into it then it will throw a helpful warning. As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: `import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';`
```
Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
};
Items.propTypes = {quantity: PropTypes.number.isRequired};
```

#### Props in ES6 class component
Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with `this`. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

+ Example: 

```
class ReturnTempPassword extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
            { /* change code below this line */ }
            <p>Your temporary password is: <strong>{this.props.tempPassword}</strong></p>
            { /* change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};

class ResetPassword extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
          <h2>Reset Password</h2>
          <h3>We've generated a new temporary password for you.</h3>
          <h3>Please reset this password from your account settings ASAP.</h3>
          { /* change code below this line */ }
            <ReturnTempPassword tempPassword='hellocow'/>
          { /* change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};
```


A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). Finally, a stateful component is any component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.

A common pattern is to try to minimize statefulness and to create stateless functional components wherever possible. This helps contain your state management to a specific area of your application. 

### State
State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. You create state in a React component by declaring a `stat`e property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this:

```
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // initialize state here
    this.state = {
      name: 'Dom'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

+ Longer Defintion of State: 

Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() method. You can access the data with this.state.
  
If you want to access a state value within the return of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.
  
State is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.
  
Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.

#### Access state with JS variables 

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    // change code below this line
    const name = this.state.name
    // change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
          <h1>{name}</h1>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

#### Update state 
You call the `setState` method within your component class like so: this.setState(), passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // change code below this line
    this.setState({
      name: 'React Rocks!'
    })
    // change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

#### Add Methods 
A class method typically needs to use the `this` keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as `state` and `props`) inside the scope of the method. One common way is to explicitly bind `this` in the constructor so `this` becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. 

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      itemCount: 0
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.addItem = this.addItem.bind(this);
    // change code above this line
  }
  addItem() {
    this.setState({
      itemCount: this.state.itemCount + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* change code below this line */ }
        <button onClick={this.addItem}>Click Me</button>
        { /* change code above this line */ }
        <h1>Current Item Count: {this.state.itemCount}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

#### Use State to Toggle and Element
You can use `state` in React applications in more complex ways than what you've seen so far. One example is to monitor the status of a value, then render the UI conditionally based on this value.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this);
    // change code above this line
  }
  // change code below this line
  toggleVisibility() {
    let value = this.state.visibility ? false : true;
    this.setState({visibility: value}); 
  }
  // change code above this line
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
};
```

+ Another example using a counter to set state: 

```
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
    // change code below this line
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this);
    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this);
    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this);
    // change code above this line
  }
  // change code below this line
  increment() {
    this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
  }
  decrement() {
    this.setState({count: this.state.count -1})
  }
  reset() {
    this.setState({count: 0})
  }
  // change code above this line
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button className='inc' onClick={this.increment}>Increment!</button>
        <button className='dec' onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement!</button>
        <button className='reset' onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>
        <h1>Current Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

#### Controlled Input form 

### Styles
We can apply CSS styles to React elements the same way as JS.  Set the `className` attribute equal to an imported class from a stylesheet. We can also use inline-styling, here's an example of the syntax.
```
<div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>
```
Hyphenated styles like `font-size` are changed to camelCase `fontSize`.  All property value units are assumed to be `px` unless otherwise specified.  Other than length values all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.  If you have a large number of styles you can declare an object and use that instead. 
```
const styles = {
  color: 'purple',
  fontSize: 40,
  border: '2px solid purple'
}
```

### Use javascript in methods
We can use advanced javascript in methods before we render the output.  Then when we want to render we just evaluate the JS (hopefully just a variable) in curly braces. 

```
const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
}

class MagicEightBall extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      userInput: '',
      randomIndex: ''
    }
    this.ask = this.ask.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  ask() {
    if (this.state.userInput) {
      this.setState({
        randomIndex: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
        userInput: ''
      });
    }
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      userInput: event.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    const possibleAnswers = [
      'It is certain',
      'It is decidedly so',
      'Without a doubt', 
      'Yes, definitely',
      'You may rely on it',
      'As I see it, yes',
      'Outlook good',
      'Yes',
      'Signs point to yes',
      'Reply hazy try again',
      'Ask again later',
      'Better not tell you now',
      'Cannot predict now',
      'Concentrate and ask again',
      'Don\'t count on it', 
      'My reply is no',
      'My sources say no',
      'Most likely',
      'Outlook not so good',
      'Very doubtful'
    ];
    const answer = possibleAnswers[this.state.randomIndex] // << change code here
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.userInput}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          style={inputStyle} /><br />
        <button onClick={this.ask}>
          Ask the Magic Eight Ball!
        </button><br />
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p>
          { /* change code below this line */ }
          {answer}
          { /* change code above this line */ }
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### If/Else example 

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      display: true
    }
    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.setState({
      display: !this.state.display
    });
  }
  render() {
    // change code below this line
    if(this.state.display) {
    return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         <h1>Displayed!</h1>
       </div>
    );
  } else {
    return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
       </div>
    );
  }
  }
};
```

### &&
`&&` allows you to evaluate an expression and if true it can render the subsequent JSX markup.  This allows us to chain together more complex if/else blocks in a more concise manner. In this case we don't need a full if/else statement - we just use it to toggle the `h1` section. 

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      display: true
    }
    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.setState({
      display: !this.state.display
    });
  }
  render() {
    // change code below this line
    return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         {this.state.display && <h1>Displayed!</h1>}
       </div>
    );
  }
};
```

+ This is the same xample using the `ternary` operator 

```
const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
}

class CheckUserAge extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // change code below this line
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      userAge: ''
    }
    // change code above this line
    this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({
      input: e.target.value,
      userAge: ''
    });
  }
  submit() {
    this.setState({
      userAge: this.state.input
    });
  }
  render() {
    const buttonOne = <button onClick={this.submit}>Submit</button>;
    const buttonTwo = <button>You May Enter</button>;
    const buttonThree = <button>You Shall Not Pass</button>;
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Enter Your Age to Continue</h3>
        <input
          style={inputStyle}
          type="number"
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange} /><br />
        {
          this.state.userAge == '' ? buttonOne : this.state.userAge >= 18 ? buttonTwo : buttonThree
        }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```


## Redux 
Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.

In Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.

This also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it must do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.  Here is an example store creation with a dummy reducer function: 

```
const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}
const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
```

**getState()** We can return state using the method `.getState`

```
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);
const currentState = store.getState();
console.log(currentState); // returns 5
```

### Actions 
In redux we update state (a core task) by dispatching actions.  Actions are javascript objects that contain information about an event that occured.  Example `{type: 'LOGIN'}`.  Some actions may include optional data, but a `type` key is required.  Think of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store.  

#### Action Creator 
Once we have an action template - the next step is to define an action creator that returns it.  This is just a javascript function that returns an action.  Here we define an action creator that returns a login action.  
```
const actionCreator = () => {
  return {type: 'LOGIN'}
}
```

#### Dispatch an action event 
In order to pass an action into the store we use the `dispatch` method.  Example: `store.dispatch(actionCreator())`.  Next, once an action is dispatched, the Redux store needs to respond to that action.  This is the job of a reducer function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state.  
  
Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll practice this in later challenges.

```
const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'LOGIN') {
    return {login: true};  // we need to return a new state here rather than setting state.login = true; then returning that object
  }
  return state;
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};
```

A common practice when working with Redux is to assign action types as read-only constants, then reference these constants wherever they are used.  It's generally a convention to write constants in all uppercase, and this is standard practice in Redux as well.

```
const LOGIN = 'LOGIN'; 
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT'

const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {

  switch (action.type) {

    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }

    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }

    default:
      return state;

  }

};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGIN
  }
};

const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGOUT
  }
};
```

#### Store Listener

#### Redux Questions 
Question: What is redux? 
Question: How many states does redux have? 
Question: What is a redux action?
Answer: An action is a javascript object that contains information about an action that occurred.  The store recieves actions - then updates its state accordingly.
Question: What property is required in a redux action? 
Answer: the "type" property is required - data is optional.    
Question: Redux state is read only.  What does this imply about changing state?
Answer: Whenever an action is sent to the store the reducer function must return a new state.  This implies state is immutable. 
Question: What is a reducer function? 
Question: What method retrieves the state from the Redux store? 
Answer: getState()
