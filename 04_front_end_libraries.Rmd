# Front End Libraries 
These are my notes from the Front End Libraries [certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/bootstrap) from FreeCodeCamp! 

## Bootstrap 
Bootstrap is a front-end framework used to design responsive web pages and web applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development. Bootstrap includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality. Bootstrap uses a responsive 12 column grid layout and has design templates for: buttons, images, tables, forms, and navigation.
  
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design. 

### Add bootstrap 
You can add bootstrap by adding this code snippet to the top of your HTML
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
```

### Bootstrap classes
class | explanation 
------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
`class = img-responsive` |  make an image fit exactly the width of your screen.
`class = text-center` | center text 
`text-primary` | 
`img-responsive` | 
`form-control` | 
`btn-default` | applies border radius 
`btn btn-primary` | applies border-radius, blue background, and white text styling
`div class='well'` | creates a perception of depth 

### Buttons 
Bootstrap has default button styles that look better than normal ones.  
```
<button class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
```
If we add the `btn-block` class it will expand to fill the horizontal space and any elements that follow it will be pushed to a new line. 
```
<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
```
The `btn-primary` class is the main color you'll use in your app.  We use this in place of `btn-default`
The `btn-info` is another color scheme that calls attention to the user. (lighter blue)
The `btn-danger` class provides a red styling - warns of a destructive action like deleting.  


### BootStrap Grid 
Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element. Bootstrap has different column width attributes that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is. For example, phones have narrow screens, and laptops have wider screens.Take for example Bootstrap's `col-md-*` class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.

+ This example creates a 3 column row.  `xs` refers to extra small - for phone screens.  4 refers to the number of columns each `div` spans.  
```
 <div class='row'>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><button class="btn btn-block btn-primary">Like</button></div>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><button class="btn btn-block btn-info">Info</button></div>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><button class="btn btn-block btn-danger">Delete</button></div>
</div>
```

+ Bootstrap's responsive system will resize images so that they fit on the same line. (Remove the bootstrap classes from the following html to see the effect) 
```
<div class='row'>
  <div class='col-xs-8'><h2 class="text-primary text-center">CatPhotoApp</h2></div>
  <div class='col-xs-4'><a href="#"><img class="img-responsive thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a></div>
</div>
```

+ We can also nest radio buttons in a responsive layout 

```
 <div class='row'>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label></div>
    <div class='col-xs-6'><label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Crazy</label></div>
  </div>
```

### span 
We can use a `<span>` element to create styles for inline elements. We then assign a class to the span to apply styling.   
```
.text-danger {
  color: red;
}
<p>Things cats <span class='text-danger'>love:</span></p>
```

### Font awesome
Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons are vector graphics, stored in the .svg (scalable vector graphic) file format. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements. You need to include the link to the Font awesome style sheet in the `<head>` element to use the icons. 
```
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
```

+ You can also use a `span` tag for FA icons: 
```
<span class='fa fa-info-circle'></span>
```

+ You can also put icons in buttons for added effect: 
```
<button class="btn btn-block btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> Like</button>
```

### Create a bootstrap layout. 
To create a responsive layout elements need to be wrapped in `div class='container-fluid></div>`.  You then use row and column classess to create desired layouts. 
```
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6">
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6">
  </div>
</div>
```

### Class targeting 
Sometimes we apply classes to html elements without any CSS styling to select them easie when using jQuery. Here we add the "target" class with no styling.   
```
<button class="btn btn-default target"></button>
```

<hr>

## jQuery
jQuery is one of the many libraries for JavaScript. It is designed to simplify scripting done on the client side. jQuery's most recognizable characteristic is its dollar sign ($) syntax. With it, you can easily manipulate elements, create animations and handle input events.

Add the following code to the top of the HTML document to initialize jQuery: 
```
<script>$(document).ready(function() {
});
</script>
```

### Methods 
#### selector 
All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling.
jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element. For example, let's make all of the button elements bounce. 
```
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
  $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
  });
</script>
```

We can target a classes and ids by using the same `.` and `#` syntax: 
```
$('.class-name').addClass('animated shake');
$("#target3").addClass("animated fadeOut");
```

#### Change CSS
We can change the CSS of an element by using the `.css()` function. 
```
$('#target1').css('color', 'blue');
``` 

#### Change properties
jQuery has a function called `.prop()` that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.
Here's how you would disable all buttons:
```
$("button").prop("disabled", true);
```

#### Change text inside elements
jQuery has a function called `.html()` that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.
```
$("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");
```
jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.


#### remove elements 
We can remove elements by using the `.remove()` function. 
```
$('#target4').remove();
```

#### move elements
jQuery has a function called `appendTo()` that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.
```
$('.class').appendTo('#id')
```

#### clone elements 
jQuery has a function called `clone()` that makes a copy of an element. We can use this in conjunction with `appendTo()` to copy-paste elements 
```
$('#id').clone().appendTo('.class')
```

#### parent function
jQuery has a function called `parent()` that accesses the parent of the selected element.  This examples changes the parent's background color 
```
$('.class').parent().css('background-color', 'blue)
```

#### children function 
jQuery has a function called `children()` that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.
```
$("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")
```

#### CSS Selectors 
jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. The `target:nth-child(n)` CSS selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type. NOTE: you don't select the parent element - you specify the class you're targeting and nth-child specifies what index you want.  A better name for this would be `nth-index`.  NOTE: this will also select that index for every grouping of these classes.  If, for instance, there are two lists and you want the second item, this will select the second item in BOTH lists.  
```
$(".target:nth-child(3)").addClass("animated bounce");
```
We can also target even or odd elements (based on index) with similar syntax: 
```
$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");
```

#### Hilarious page animation 
```
    $('body').addClass('animated hinge')
```

## SaSS 
Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available using basic CSS syntax. Sass makes it easier for developers to simplify and maintain the style sheets for their projects.

Sass can extend the CSS language because it is a preprocessor. It takes code written using Sass syntax, and converts it into basic CSS. This allows you to create variables, nest CSS rules into others, and import other Sass files, among other things. The result is more compact, easier to read code.

There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) and used throughout these challenges, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the same meaning. Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.

The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just "Sass"), uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.


+ We can create variables in SaSS with the `$` and set their values. 

```
$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;
h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}
```

+ We can nest multiple CSS rules inside their parent elements 

```
nav {
  background-color: red;

  ul {
    list-style: none;

    li {
      display: inline-block;
    }
  }
}
```

### mixin
mixins are like functions for CSS.  Here is the syntax for defining one: 
```
@mixin box-shadow($x, $y, $blur, $c){ 
  -webkit-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  -moz-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  -ms-box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
  box-shadow: $x, $y, $blur, $c;
}
```
Now any time a box-shadow rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the vendor prefixes. A mixin is called with the `@include` directive:
```
div {
  @include box-shadow(0px, 0px, 4px, #fff);
}
```

```
  @mixin border-radius($radius){
    -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
    -moz-border-radius: $radius;
    -ms-border-radius: $radius;
    border-radius: $radius;
  }
```

+ we can also create if/else statements with `@if` and `@else`

```
  @mixin border-stroke($val) {
    @if $val == light {
      border: 1px solid black;
    } @else if $val == medium {
      border: 3px solid black;
    } @else if $val == heavy {
      border: 6px solid black;
    } @else {
      border: none;
    }
  }
```

### for loop
+ `@for` is used in two ways: "start through end" or "start to end". The main difference is that "start to end" excludes the end number, and "start through end" includes the end number.
Example: 
```
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .col-#{$i} { width: 100%/12 * $i; }
}
```
Here's what it looks like when it's converted to CSS:

```
.col-1 {
  width: 8.33333%;
}

.col-2 {
  width: 16.66667%;
}

...
.col-12 {
  width: 100%;
}
```

### each 
Same concept as for loop except you can define specific values - this is useful for colors

```
@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {color: $color;}
}
```

### while 
Apparently these can break style sheets reeally easily - be sure to define the end clause FIRST.
```
$x: 1;
@while $x < 13 {
  .col-#{$x} { width: 100%/12 * $x;}
  $x: $x + 1;
}
```

### Partials 
Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.

Names for partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the .scss file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the `@import` directive.

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the main file:

```
// In the main.scss file
@import 'mixins'
```

### extend 
We can import the properties from one class to another class if we wish to add on (gets rid of excessive copy-pasting)

```
.panel{
  background-color: red;
  height: 70px;
  border: 2px solid green;
}

.big-panel{
  @extend .panel;
  width: 150px;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```
