## Require.js
RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code.

`waitSeconds`: The number of seconds to wait before giving up on loading a script. Setting it to 0 disables the timeout.
